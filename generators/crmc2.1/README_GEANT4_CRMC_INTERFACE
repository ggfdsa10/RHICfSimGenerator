INSTALLATION:

	- Install/setup Geant4 (if not yet done)

		1) download geant4.10.01.p02.tar (or later version) from http://geant4.web.cern.ch/geant4/support/download.shtml

		2) unpack geant4.10.01.p02.tar, for example in directory <myG4Path>.
		
		   $ cd <myG4Path>
                   $ tar -zxf geant4.10.01.p02.tar

		3) $ mkdir geant4.10.01-build

		4) $ cd geant4.10.01-build

		5) $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<myG4Path>/geant4.10.01-install -DGEANT4_INSTALL_DATA=ON \\ 
		           -DGEANT4_USE_GDML=ON -DGEANT4_USE_OPENGL_X11=ON -DGEANT4_INSTALL_EXAMPLES=ON -DGEANT4_USE_QT=ON \\
		            <myG4Path>/geant4.10.01.p02

		NOTE: -DGEANT4_USE_QT=ON  flag is optional (QT driver is convenient for visualizing the detector)
		NOTE: -DGEANT4_BUILD_MULTITHREADED=ON  - optional, add this for multithread mode support

		6) $ make -j2 (for duo-core machine)

		7) $ make install

		8) Setup geant4: 

		   $ cd <myG4Path>/geant4.10.01-install/share/Geant4-10.4.2/geant4make
		   $ source geant4make.sh 

	 -  Install HEPMC (if not yet done)

	 	See http://lcgapp.cern.ch/project/simu/HepMC/download/

		- you can install it either from source, or using the compiled binary, 
		  e.g. x86_64-slc6-gcc46-opt (or slc5, depending on your scientific linux version)

		    
		- Set up HEPC environment variable

		   $ export HEPMC_PREFIX=/path/to/your/HEPMC/x86_64-slc6-gcc48-opt/ 

		  ... (i.e. set HEPMC_PREFIX to the path of HEPMC installation, 
		  the path where the 'lib' and 'include' directories of HEPMC are)


	
	 
	-  Install CRMC

		   $ git clone --single-branch --branch svn/geant4 git@gitlab.ikp.kit.edu:AirShowerPhysics/crmc.git
		   $ mkdir crmc-geant4-build   /// (this is where  libraries and headers are installed)
		   $ cd crmc-geant4-build  
		   $ cmake ../crmc
		   $ make install




SETUP ENVIRONMENT

	This should be done in every new console (e.g. in your ~/.bash_profile)

	- Setup Geant4 (see step 8 in installation)

		   $ cd <myG4Path>/geant4.10.01-install/share/Geant4-10.4.2/geant4make
		   $ source geant4make.sh

EXAMPLE: USING CRMC IN GEANT4 PROGRAM


	Based on the standard examples/extended/hadronic/Hadr01 
 
	1) Get Hadr01 example

		   $ cp -r $G4INSTALL/../examples/extended/hadronic/Hadr01 ./
		   $ cd Hadr01
		   $ make -j8


	2) Create your run macro with high-energy protons:

		   $ cp hadr01.in he.in

	   Then, in he.in change :

		   /gun/energy 3. GeV       to    /gun/energy 2000. TeV
		   /testhadr/Physics QBBC   to   /testhadr/Physics  FTFP_BERT    


		
	3) (Optional) Try to run your high-energy macro using the standard hadronic model:
	
		   $ Hadr01 he.in


			it should crash with the following error:

			-------- EEEE ------- G4Exception-START -------- EEEE -------
			*** G4Exception : had005
			      issued by : G4HadronElasticProcess::PostStepDoIt
			In /atlas/users/andrii/geant4/geant4.10.04.p02/source/processes/hadronic/management/src/G4EnergyRangeManager.cc, line 129:

			-------- EEEE ------- G4Exception-START -------- EEEE -------

		And, this is normal! We can't generate 2 PeV protons using the standard Geant4 phsyics list (FTFP_BERT)
		The purpose of this step is to make sure your Geant4 code is okay and running as expected.



	4) Add CRMC "physics list" to your code
	
		  a) Modify GNUmakefile

		     Adding the following two lines before  .PHONY: all  :

			     LOADLIBS=$(CRMC_LIB_PATH)/libCrmc.so
			     LOADLIBS+=$(CRMC_LIB_PATH)/libGeantCrmc.so


		  b) Add CRMC physics list in your Geant4 physics list definition

		     - Modify src/PhysicsList.cc :
			
			- add  
			  #include "G4HadronPhysicsCRMC.hh"

			- adding the following code inside 
		     	  the method void PhysicsList::AddPhysicsList(const G4String& name):

	
			  // ********************************************
			  else if (name == "FTFP_BERT_CRMC_EPOS199") {

			    AddPhysicsList("FTFP_BERT");
			    int crmc_model = 1;  
			    // where 
			    //   0 - EPOS LHC   1 - EPOS 1.99   12 - DPMJET3  
			    //   see CRMC documentation for the complete list of 
			    //   available models
			    G4HadronPhysicsCRMC* crmc = new G4HadronPhysicsCRMC(crmc_model);
			    crmc->SetEnergyThreshold(300.); // energy threshold in Gev, 
			    // starting from which interactions (both primary and secondary) 
			    // are handelled by CRMC model
			    // In this example, and hadron-hadron (ion) interaction above 
			    // 300 GeV is handeled by CRMC
			    fHadronPhys.push_back( crmc );
			  } 
			  // ********************************************

			- NOTE: the switch energy threshold corresponds to the Kinetic Energy Per Nucleon.
			        For example, threshold energy of 300 GeV corresponds to: 
				300  GeV Kinetic for proton particles
			        1200 GeV Kinetic energy for Helium ion particle, etc.
			        This threshold is set through SetMinEnergy method of a physics interaction code
			        (see ll 75-85 https://gitlab.cern.ch/geant4/geant4/blob/master/
			        source/processes/hadronic/management/src/G4EnergyRangeManager.cc)


		  c) Recompile Hadr01 

			   $ make -j8



		  d) Copy CRMC config file in the directory where you run the code

			   $ cp ${CRMC_CONFIG_FILE} ./


	
		  e) Set CRMC model in the Geant4 macro

			   In he.in change :

			   /testhadr/Physics FTFP_BERT   to   /testhadr/Physics  FTFP_BERT_CRMC_EPOS199


		  f) Run the code again

			   $ Hadr01 he.in



			  THAT'S IT. YOU HAVE CONNECTED CRMC TO GEANT4! THE SIMULATION 
			  SHOULD NOW RUN SUCCESSFULLY. YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE THE 
			  FOLLOWING MESSAGE IN THE LOG:
			  
			    ..
			    CRMC GEANT4 Interface physics initializeed
			    ..


	5) There are 2 options for switching between Geant4-CRMC hadronic models:
			a) by energy threshold, so that in every hadronic interaction:
				- if E<E_threshold Geant4 model is used
				- if E>E_threshold CRMC model is used
			b) by using energy interval where contribution of the models is changed smoothly:
				probability of interaction by specific model changes linearly in this transition region
			To set threshold one should use G4HadronPhysicsCRMC::SetEnergyThreshold(double),
				for smooth transition G4HadronPhysicsCRMC::SetEnergyThreshold(double, double).
			By default, if not specified otherwise, energy threshold of 300 GeV is used
